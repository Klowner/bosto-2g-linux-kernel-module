Bosto tablet driver 0.1a
========================

Driver for Linux kernels which is believed to support complete functionality of the tablet:
pen coordinates, touch/float/click detection, pressure, x and y tilt, pen
button. 

Based on the driver originally developed directly at Hanwang.com.cn to support the Artmaster series of Hanvon Tablets.


Supported hardware
==================

Bosto 22HD

AM - Artmaster I, RL - Rollick, GP - GraphicPal, NXS - Nilox


Installation
============

Type 'make' to compile the module. New file bosto_2g.ko will be produced in
current directory. Load the module with root permissions

insmod ./bosto_2g.ko

If everything goes right the tablet should start working immediately.
However you may find that the generic usb_hid module will bind to the device by default.
To unbind the generic usb_hid driver :

echo -n "USB_BUS_ID" > /sys/bus/usb/drivers/usbhid/unbind				e.g echo -n "2-3:1.0" > ..../unbind

Then attach the driver to the bosto_2g module.

echo -n "USB_ID" > /sys/bus/usb/drivers/bosto_2g/bind

Work in progress.


Diagnostics
===========

After insmod, check with dmesg, if the module was loaded properly.  
"Bosto 2nd Generation USB Driver module being initialised." should appear in the listing.

lsmod should also contain bosto_2g in its listing: lsmod | grep bosto_2g
